// **Compilation vs Interpretation**
//========================================

// **Compilation** is a process where entire code is converted into machine code at once.
// Then the code is written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer in the CPU.

// **Interpretation** is a process where an *Interpreter* runs through the source code and **executes the code line by line**.

// **Just-in-time Compilation** is a process that blends both **Compilation *and* Interpretation**
// We achieve this by **compiling the entire code into machine code at once, then executing it right away**.

// **What *is* Javascript?**
//========================================

// **High-level**
//========================================

// **Garbage Collection**
//========================================
// Javascript has in-built "Garbage Collection" which is an algorithm inside the Javascript engine that automatically old, unused objects from the computer's memory

// **Interpreted or Just-in-time compiled**
//========================================
// Javascript is an interpreted or "just-in-time compiled" language

// **Multi-paradigm**
//========================================
// Javascript is a multi-paradigm language
// In programming, a **Paradigm** is an approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique
// Three different programming paradigms are:
//      1. Proecedural programming
//      2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
//      3. Functional programming (FP)
// Procedural programming is what I've been doing so far, just organising the code in a very linear way with some functions in between
// We can also define many paradigms as **Imperative** vs. **Declarative**
