// Promises, Async/Await, AJAX and APIs
// ========================================
//
// Asynchronous vs Synchronous Code
// ========================================
//
// Most of the code I've been writing is known as Synchronous code
// Synchronous code just means that my code is executed line-by-line by the exact order of execution, with each line of code waiting for the previous line to finish, with long-running operations block further code execution

// Asynchronous code is executed AFTER a task that runs in the "background" finishes
// Asynchronous code is NON-BLOCKING, which means the code can execute whilst something else is running in the executon context
// Asynchronous code doesn't wait for an synchronous task to finish its work
// Callback functions on their own DO NOT make code asynchronous!!
// So, asynchronous code is typically found in input/output operations, network requests, and/or fetching data - anything that could take an indiscriminate amount of time
// Most of my APIs will be using a data format known as JSON, and JSON is basically just a javascript object that has been converted to a string
//
// AJAX
// ========================================
//
// AJAX stands for Aynschronous Javascript and XML
// AJAX allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way
// Using AJAX calls I can request data from web servers in a dynamic way
// I'd typically use an AJAX call to make a HTTP request to a web server to interact with that web server's API
// This is known as an "Online" API, and an Online API can be defined as an application that is running on a web server that RECEIVES the requests for data, retrieves that data from somewhere inside a dodgy MySQL database, retrieiving it, and consequently sending back that retrieved data as its response
// I'll be able to, one day, build my OWN web APIs (using something like Node.js) or by the use of 3rd-Party APIs
//
//
// APIs
// ========================================
//
// API stands for Application Programming Interface
// An API is a piece of software that can be used by another software in order to allow applications to talk to one another
// So, an API is essentially a self-contained piece of software that allow other pieces of software to interact with them
// remember making the public methods in our ES6 class lecture, and then I was able to essentially "interact" with my objects I assigned with the methods
//
//
// ========================================
// Using the AJAX Call: The XMLHttp Function
// ========================================

//       renderCountry(neighbourData, 'neighbour');
//     });
//   });

// Don't get trapped in CALLBACK HELL
// Callback Hell is when I have a shitload of nested callbacks in order to execute asynchronous tasks sequentially
// This happens for all asynchronous tasks, which are handled by callbacks and not just with AJAX calls
// Callback Hell also makes my code both messy and hard to maintain - no gewd.

// In Javascript, a promise is an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation
// AKA, a promise is a container for an asynchronously delivered value
// AKA, a promise is a container for a future value to be stored within
// By utilising promises, I no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results
// And instead of nesting callbacks and producing shitty code, I'm able to chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations which are actually necessary to escape callback hell - Dante's Callback LOL
//
// The Promise Lifecycle
// ========================================
//
// Before the future value is available, a promise is in the "Pending" state
// DURING THIS TIME, the ansyynchronous task is still doing its work in the background, but when that task finally finishes it is considered to be in the "Settled" state
// The state of promises can only be set ONCE (so it will stay that way indefinitely), and there are TWO (2) kinds of "Settled" states:

// ========================================
// FULFILLED Promises, where a promise has successfully resulted in a stored value (like successfully retrieving data from an API)
// REJECTED Promises, where a promise has FAILED in retrieving data from an API, like when you live in Australia and literally have ADSL/2+ so I don't have the speed or bandwidth to connect to already slow APIs (lmao)
// ========================================

// When I get the result of a promise, and consequently use it, this is known as "CONSUMING" the promise
// And a promise can ONLY be consumed when I already have that promise to BE consumed
// When I want to CONSUME that promise I successfully fetched, I can use the .then() method, and I need to pass a callback function that executes as soon as the promise is fulfilled, with the function recieving ONE argument: the resulting value of that fulfilled promise
// Then in order to actually read that retrieved data, I need to call the json() method on that response
// The json() method is a method that is available on ALL responses of the fetch method
// The only issue with the json() method is that it's ALSO an aysnchronous function, which means it will ALSO return a NEW promise, so I'll need to both return the promise, but also handle that new promise
// I do that by, as I said before, chaining methods, in this case I want to chain the .then() method
// Important to note that the .then() method ALWAYS returns a promise, irrespective of whether any data is actually returned or not, but if we DO retujrn a value, then THAT value will become the value of the returned promise
// So, I always want to return a promise, then handle it OUTSIDE of the chain with the .then() method
//
//
// ========================================
// Handling Rejected Promises
// ========================================
//
// I have two ways of handling rejected promises:

// 1. Pass a second callback function INTO the .then() method that handles the returned promise
// Since the .then() method's first callback function is for successful response promise states, and I can denote that with "err"
// VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Any error I get in any of the callback functions nested within their respective .then() handlers will immediately TERMINATE that .then() handler, consequently propagating down to my .catch() error handler function
