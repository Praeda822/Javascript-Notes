// Promises, Async/Await, AJAX and APIs
// ========================================
//
// Asynchronous vs Synchronous Code
// ========================================
//
// Most of the code I've been writing is known as Synchronous code
// Synchronous code just means that my code is executed line-by-line by the exact order of execution, with each line of code waiting for the previous line to finish, with long-running operations block further code execution

// Asynchronous code is executed AFTER a task that runs in the "background" finishes
// Asynchronous code is NON-BLOCKING, which means the code can execute whilst something else is running in the executon context
// Asynchronous code doesn't wait for an synchronous task to finish its work
// Callback functions on their own DO NOT make code asynchronous!!
// So, asynchronous code is typically found in input/output operations, network requests, and/or fetching data - anything that could take an indiscriminate amount of time
// Most of my APIs will be using a data format known as JSON, and JSON is basically just a javascript object that has been converted to a string
//
// AJAX
// ========================================
//
// AJAX stands for Aynschronous Javascript and XML
// AJAX allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way
// Using AJAX calls I can request data from web servers in a dynamic way
// I'd typically use an AJAX call to make a HTTP request to a web server to interact with that web server's API
// This is known as an "Online" API, and an Online API can be defined as an application that is running on a web server that RECEIVES the requests for data, retrieves that data from somewhere inside a dodgy MySQL database, retrieiving it, and consequently sending back that retrieved data as its response
// I'll be able to, one day, build my OWN web APIs (using something like Node.js) or by the use of 3rd-Party APIs
//
//
// APIs
// ========================================
//
// API stands for Application Programming Interface
// An API is a piece of software that can be used by another software in order to allow applications to talk to one another
// So, an API is essentially a self-contained piece of software that allow other pieces of software to interact with them
// remember making the public methods in our ES6 class lecture, and then I was able to essentially "interact" with my objects I assigned with the methods
//
//
// ========================================
// Using the AJAX Call: The XMLHttp Function
// ========================================

const btn = document.querySelector('.btn-country');
const countriesContainer = document.querySelector('.countries');

// The OLD SKOOL Way
// ========================================

// FINALLY I'll assign this entire functionality to its own respective function
const getCountryData = function (country_name) {
  // First I create a new object and call the XMLHttpRequest() function, storing that result in a variable
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

  // Next I call the open function on my variable and pass in the 'GET' data-type, followed by a string containing where the AJAX call needs to be made
  // This is also known as the API Endpoint
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country_name}`);
  // And I'll then need to SEND that request off
  request.send();

  // Then I need to register a callback on the request object that listens for the 'load' event
  // So this returns a SHITLOAD of text (in JSON format)
  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    // And then I need to convert that JSON string into my javascript object
    // Since data is an array containing an object, I can destructure it as well
    const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    console.log(data);

    // And then I'll create a template literal to create the cool card thing in the HTML
    // Remember I can use + to convert to a number
    const html = `
<article class="country">
  <img class="country__img" src="${data.flag}" />
  <div class="country__data">
    <h3 class="country__name">${data.name}</h3>
    <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üë´</span>${(
      +data.population / 25687041
    ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üó£Ô∏è</span>${data.languages}</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üí∞</span>${data.currencies.name}</p>
  </div>
</article>
`;
    // And then I'll pretty much just add this to my document by sending it to my countries container
    // Which would be great is I could even FUCKING see it since the API times out every single fucken time
    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
    countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
  });
};

getCountryData('australia');
getCountryData('portgual');
